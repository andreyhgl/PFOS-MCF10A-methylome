+ epigenome project using EM-seq
+ dataset made on normal human breast cell line (MCF10A) and has been exposed to PFOS
+ perflourooctane sulfuric acid (PFOS) is compound produced by ..., and has harmful effects on humans
+ The code in the repository was used to for computational analysis for the peer-review paper : [Pierozan, HÃ¶glund, Theodoropoulou, Karlsson (2024) Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) induced cancer related methylome alterations in human breast cells _journal_](doi)
+ THe analysis is composed of mapping and coverage calculations, differential methylation analysis, gene ontology analysis
